    "A very simple encryption technique is called the [Caesar cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). The basic idea is that each letter is replaced by a letter that is a certain number of letters away, so for example if the shift was 2, then A would become C, B would become D, and Z will become B.\n",

    "- you should accept lowercase and uppercase letters, and return letters of the same case\n",
    "- spaces or other punctuation characters should not be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to reach this result. Just pick the one which makes more sense to you. Then, decrypt the following message, which was encrypted with a shift of 13:\n",

    "[SRTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) is a digital elevation model at ~90 m resolution covering almost the entire globe (up to $\\pm$ 60° latitude). The data is organized in 5°x5° tiles. To see a map of the tiles have a look at [this download page](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SELECTION/inputCoord.asp). This tool is nice to use if you know which tile you want, but not very useful if you want more than one tile at different places of the globe.\n",
    "\n",

    "- the first two digits number gives the location of the tile in the longitudes (starting at 180° West)\n",
    "- the last two digits gives the location of the tile in the latitudes (starting at 60° North and going southwards)\n",
