    "[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are two fundamental pillars of the scientific python stack. You will find *numerous* tutorials for both libraries online. I am asking you to learn the basics of both tools by yourself, at the pace that suits you. Personally I recommend to follow these two tutorials from the Scipy Lecture Notes for a start:\n",
    "- [numpy tutorial](https://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/index.html)\n",
